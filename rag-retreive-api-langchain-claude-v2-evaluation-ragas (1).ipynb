    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application using Retrieve API provide by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, along with LangChain and RAGAS for evaluating the responses. Here, we will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search, prompt the query using Anthropic Claude, and then evaluate the responses effectively using Ragas evaluation metrics, such as faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision based expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With knowledge bases, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](!https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on the knowledge base created in the previous notebook or using console. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and stored in Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). \n",
    "2. Ingestion - Knowledge base will split them into smaller chunks (based on the strategy selected), generate embeddings and store it in the associated vectore store.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our notebook we will use the `Retreive API` provided by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock which converts user queries into\n",
    "embeddings, searches the knowledge base, and returns the relevant results, giving you more control to build custom\n",
    "workﬂows on top of the semantic search results. The output of the `Retrieve API` includes the the `retrieved text chunks`, the `location type` and `URI` of the source data, as well as the relevance `scores` of the retrievals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the text chunks being generated and augment it with the original prompt and pass it through the `anthropic.claude-instant-v1` model using prompt engineering patterns based for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will evaluate the generated responses using RAGAS on using metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevancy,and context precision. For evaluation, we will use `anthropic.claude-v2:1`.\n",
    "### Ask question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![retrieveapi.png](./images/retrieveAPI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "1. Utilize Ragas for evaluation on \n",
    "    1. **Faithfulness:** This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "    2. **Answer Relevancy:** The evaluation metric, Answer Relevancy, focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information. This metric is computed using the question and the answer, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better relevancy.\n",
    "    3. **Context Precision:** Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "    4. **Context Recall:** Context recall measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. It is computed based on the ground truth and the retrieved context, and the values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### USE CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the knowledge base. You will need the `knowledge base id` to run this example.\n",
    "In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",
